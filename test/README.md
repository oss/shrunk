shrunk: Unit Tests
==================
Unit tests for shrunk.

Running Tests
-------------
Tests depend on `nose`. To run all of the tests, simply do:

    $ nosetests

To run only one test or tests, specify their names as arguments:

    $ nosetests test_feature.py

Note that these should be done in an appropriate virtual environment so that the
application has all of its required dependencies.
